Interview Challenges

The included cpp files are from three challenge questions I received for a job interview for a c++ developer position.

1. myMatrix.cpp & myMatrix.h both are from question 1 and use the boost external libraries for the matrix creation.
  These two files are simply to display the basic understanding of header files, classes, and operator overloading.
  
2. q2.cpp is a simple display of using file i/o and use of some STL functions.

3. q3.cpp finds the longest commong substring and is a simple display of algorithm usage.
